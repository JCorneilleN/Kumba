"# Kumba" 

It's free to use, but I would appreciate it if you can give me a shoutout if you do. I am a new graduate trying  to find a job as a developper lol.

If you would like to download the windows app (exe), go to https://drive.google.com/file/d/15azxfcOre1HWsacRIGkzxuvtKGcI6l1V/view?usp=sharing to follow the instructions and download the App.

I am working on the Android version right now.

You can contact me through email: kumbangai@gmail.com
